// applyMergeCommitAdjustment applies ceiling division to line counts for merge commits.
// This function implements a heuristic to estimate the actual impact of a merge commit
// by dividing accumulated line changes by the number of parents. The ceiling division
// ensures we don't truncate small values to zero, which would be misleading.
//
// Rationale for this approach:
// 1. Merge commits often contain changes that appear in multiple parent diffs
// 2. Simple summation would overcount the actual impact of the merge
// 3. Division by parent count provides a reasonable estimate of the merge's true impact
// 4. Ceiling division prevents underestimation for small changes
//
// This is a pragmatic heuristic rather than a perfect solution, as true merge analysis
// would require complex conflict resolution analysis that's beyond the scope of this tool.
