**Gitallica** performs temporal diff analysis of distributed version control logs to help you understand code evolution, identify risks, and optimize team workflows. Analyze churn patterns, code survival rates, and other engineering metrics to make data-driven decisions about your codebase health.

## Features

- **14 Research-Backed Metrics**: Based on industry studies from Microsoft Research, DORA, and Clean Code principles
- **DORA Compliance**: Elite/High/Medium/Low performance classification using Accelerate benchmarks
- **Real Git Analysis**: Authentic repository analysis using go-git (no external dependencies)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From code survival to change lead time, bus factor to commit cadence
- **CLI-First Design**: Simple commands with powerful filtering and time-window analysis

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze code churn patterns
gitallica churn --last 30d

# Check code survival rates
gitallica survival --last 6m

# Measure DORA performance
gitallica change-lead-time --limit 10
```

## Installation

**Coming soon**: Homebrew installation will be available after project stabilization.

For now, build from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bgricker/gitallica.git
cd gitallica
go build -o gitallica .
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Description | Research Basis |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `churn` | Additions vs. deletions ratio | Microsoft Research |
| `survival` | Code survival rate analysis | MSR, CodeScene |
| `churn-files` | High-churn files identification | Martin Fowler |
| `component-creation` | New component creation rate | Industry benchmarks |
| `directory-entropy` | Directory structure entropy | Edsger Dijkstra |
| `dead-zones` | Untouched code identification | Robert C. Martin |
| `bus-factor` | Knowledge concentration analysis | Martin Fowler |
| `ownership-clarity` | Code ownership patterns | Industry research |
| `onboarding-footprint` | New contributor analysis | Robert C. Martin |
| `test-ratio` | Test-to-code ratio | Robert C. Martin |
| `high-risk-commits` | Large commit identification | Kent Beck, Martin Fowler |
| `commit-cadence` | Commit frequency trends | Kent Beck |
| `long-lived-branches` | Branch lifecycle analysis | DORA research |
| `change-lead-time` | DORA lead time metrics | Accelerate research |

**Note**: Review Bottlenecks (#13) requires GitHub API integration and is planned for future implementation.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Analyze entire repository
gitallica churn

# Time-scoped analysis
gitallica survival --last 3m

# Path-specific analysis
gitallica bus-factor --path src/
```

### Advanced Filtering
```bash
# Combined filters
gitallica churn --last 90d --path lib/

# Detailed output
gitallica change-lead-time --limit 20 --method tag
```
